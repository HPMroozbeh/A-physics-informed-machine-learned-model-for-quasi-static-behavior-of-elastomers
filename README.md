### Summary
This work proposes a framework to hire concepts from polymer science, statistical physics, and continuum mechanics to provide super-constrained machine-learning techniques of reduced-order to partly overcome the existing difficulties. Using a sequential order-reduction, we have simplified the 3D stressâ€“strain tensor mapping problem into a limited number of super-constrained 1D mapping problems. Next, we introduce an assembly of multiple replicated neural network learning agents (L-agents) to systematically classify those mapping problems into a few categories, each of which were described by a distinct agent type. By capturing all loading modes through a simplified set of dispersed experimental data, the proposed hybrid assembly of L-agents provides a new generation of machine-learned approaches that simply outperform most constitutive laws in training speed, and accuracy even in complicated loading scenarios. Interestingly, the physics-based nature of the proposed model avoids the low interpretability of conventional machine-learned models.
